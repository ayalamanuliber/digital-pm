---

## 🔥 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO (10 MINUTES)

### **STEP 1: Install Required Packages**

Open your terminal in the project folder and run:

```bash
npm install @vercel/kv date-fns react-hot-toast
```

Wait for installation to complete (should take 30-60 seconds).

---

### **STEP 2: Setup Vercel KV Database**

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
   - Open: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Click on your project: `digital-pm-skku`

2. **Create KV Store**
   - Click the **"Storage"** tab at the top
   - Click **"Create Database"** button
   - Select **"KV"** (NOT Postgres, NOT Blob - must be KV!)
   - Database Name: `pm-worker-storage`
   - Region: `us-east-1` (or closest to you)
   - Click **"Create"**

3. **Connect to Your Project**
   - It will ask: "Connect to project?"
   - Select: `digital-pm-skku`
   - Environment: **Check ALL** (Production, Preview, Development)
   - Click **"Connect"**

4. **Verify Environment Variables**
   - Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
   - You should now see these added automatically:
     ```
     KV_REST_API_URL
     KV_REST_API_TOKEN
     KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN
     KV_URL
     ```
   - ✅ If you see these 4 variables, you're done!

---

### **STEP 3: Pull Environment Variables Locally**

In your terminal, run:

```bash
vercel env pull .env.local
```

This downloads the KV credentials to your local environment.

---

### **STEP 4: Deploy to Vercel**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add worker mobile login with PIN authentication"
git push
```

Vercel will auto-deploy (takes 1-2 minutes).
